# Migration Execution Log

## Phase 1 - Preparation
- [x] Branch created: `refactor-file-structure`
- [x] Branch pushed to remote: `origin/refactor-file-structure`
- [⚠️] Current state verification: **BLOCKED**
  - Issue: Node.js 23.7.0 compatibility issue with better-sqlite3
  - Error: C++20 compilation errors, V8 API changes
  - Status: Cannot test current functionality due to dependency issue

## Issues Encountered

### Node.js Compatibility Issue
- **Problem**: better-sqlite3 package fails to compile with Node.js 23.7.0
- **Error**: C++20 compilation errors, V8 API changes in Node.js 23.x
- **Impact**: Cannot test current state before migration
- **Solutions**: 
  1. Test with Docker instead (works on Railway)
  2. Use a compatible Node.js version (18.x or 20.x)
  3. Proceed with migration and test in containerized environment

## Decision
Since the application works fine on Railway (deployed via Docker), we'll proceed with the migration and test using Docker containers instead of local Node.js execution.

## Phase 1 - Modified Approach
- [x] Branch created: `refactor-file-structure`
- [x] Branch pushed to remote: `origin/refactor-file-structure`
- [x] Current state verified via Docker (working perfectly)
  - ✅ Login page loads: `http://localhost:3001/login.html`
  - ✅ CSS assets load: `http://localhost:3001/css/style.css`
  - ✅ Authentication protection working: Main app redirects to login
  - ✅ All containers start successfully: emmaphone, redis, livekit
